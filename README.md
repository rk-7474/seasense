# Seasense
## Listen to the ocean whisper

Seasense is a part of Planck Team's "_innovative project_" for First Lego League 2025.
The main objective of this is to create an open and public network of devices to gather oceans data, like CO2, pH and water temperature.
The sites contains an home page, an about page, an interactive map showing all the deployed devices (by now they are fake, only for demonstration). There's even a custom made charts page to track the data history and compare it with averages.

Its entirely made by me, using Next.js, drizzlejs (orm) using supabase as db, deployed on vercel. The map is implemented trough a js library using [open street map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
